Motion Detection and Feature Extraction

Overview

This project focuses on detecting motion objects in a video, converting the video into frames, and extracting specific features from the detected motion in the frames.

The process involves:

Motion detection to identify moving objects in the video.

Frame extraction to break the video into individual images.

Feature extraction to highlight and analyze specific regions of interest within the frames.

Features

Motion Detection: Identifies and tracks moving objects using OpenCV.

Frame Conversion: Converts video into sequential image frames.

Feature Extraction: Highlights regions of interest in the frames, enabling further analysis or modification.

Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Other libraries as specified in requirements.txt.

Usage

Provide a video file as input.

Run the script to process the video and extract frames.

Use the extracted frames for feature extraction and further analysis.
